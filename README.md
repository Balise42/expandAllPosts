# expandAllPosts
A small Chrome extension to expand all posts and remove the "Show all" bar on Pluspora

Should normally trigger whenever content is added to the DOM - in my (short) testing, triggers when new posts are loaded. 

This is my first Chrome extension, and my experience with JS is limited, so: no guarantee it won't crash, format your hard drive, teleport goats, or that it'll work.

Install: download files somewhere, go to chrome://extensions, activate Developer Mode, click "Load unpacked", point to where the files are downloaded. Reload Pluspora. Enjoy.
